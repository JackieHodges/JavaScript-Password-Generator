JavaScript Password Generator


## Description

Starter code was refactored to dynamically update with JavaScript in order to enable employees to generate random passwords based on the user's requirement for length and types of characters to include.

While the button and event listener were already provided, the logic of the code had to be written. From ensuring the password length request was acceptable to implementing the requested password options, if-else statements with prompts and confirms were used. Once the user makes their selections, their secure password will display on the screen.

Functions were also used to shuffle the final password array and to generate the password itself.
